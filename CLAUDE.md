We are reimplementing the firmware of the ASM2464PD chip in C in the src/ directory. The official firmware is in fw.bin.

We are trying to match each function in the original firmware to ours, giving good names to the functions and registers and structuring the src/ directory well.

Our firmware should build and the output should match fw.bin as close as possible. Build temporaries and artifacts should go in build/ The firmware we build should run on the device.

You can use radare on the fw.bin files to get the 8051 assembly, don't forget the 8051 architecture flag. Be aware 8051 only has a 64kb code size, so addresses above 0x8000 can be banked. There's an indirect jump/call to switch banks via DPX register (SFR 0x96).

Code address mapping:
- 0x0000-0x7FFF: Always maps to file offset 0x0000-0x7FFF (32KB shared)
- 0x8000-0xFFFF in bank 0: Maps to file offset 0x8000-0xFFFF
- 0x8000-0xFFFF in bank 1: Maps to file offset 0xFF6B + (addr - 0x8000)

Bank 1 file offsets: 0xFF6B-0x17F6A (mapped to code addresses 0x8000-0xFFFF)

BANK1 function addresses in comments should use the file offset for "actual addr", calculated as:
  file_offset = 0xFF6B + (code_addr - 0x8000)

ghidra.c is ghidra's attempt at C disassembly of the functions, you are welcome to reference it. Note: all the names in there may be wrong.

python/usb.py is tinygrad's library that talks to this chip. python/patch.py is a reflasher for this chip.

Every function you write should match one to one with a function in real firmware. Include the address range of the real function in a comment before our function.

Our firmware needs to have all the functionality of the real firmware, with all edge cases, state machines, and methods correctly implemented to match the behavior of the stock firmware.

Do not write things like `XDATA8(0xnnnn)`, instead define that as a register in include/registers.h with a good name with prefix "REG_" and use that register. Registers are addresses >= 0x6000, XDATA lower then this is global variables and shouldn't be in registers.h, put them in include/globals.h with the prefix "G_"

Do not use XDATA outside registers.h and globals.h! Don't use `*(__idata uint8_t *)0x16`, define that variable in globals. This is important.

Don't use extern void, instead include the correct header file.

Prioritize functions that you have already reversed the caller of.

Whenever you see a function or register with a name that includes the address in it, think about if you can give it a better name from context.

Registers and variables in general should not have aliases. Adding bit constants to registers.h similar to what's there is encouraged. You may not be the only one working in the repo. Don't do git checkout and make sure you read before you write.

All functions should exactly match the functions in the real firmware! It should match them one to one. This is the only way to ensure it is correct.

Checking in and making sure it builds every once in a while is good. You can also see how far along you are by comparing the size of our compiled firmware bin to fw.bin

Before reverse engineering, check all the headers to see if the functions are already there.

All functions should be functionally the same as the ones in the real firmware and should be reconstructed from the real firmware. They should have headers like
```
/*
 * pcie_clear_address_regs - Clear address offset registers
 * Address: 0x9a9c-0x9aa2 (7 bytes)
 *
 * Clears IDATA locations 0x63 and 0x64 (address offset).
 *
 * Original disassembly:
 *   9a9c: clr a
 *   9a9d: mov r0, #0x63
 ...
```

For bank 1 it should look like
```
/*
 * pcie_addr_store - Store PCIe address with offset adjustment
 * Bank 1 Address: 0x839c-0x83b8 (29 bytes) [actual addr: 0x1039c]
 *
 * Calls e902 helper, loads current address from 0x05AF,
```
Update all functions that don't match this pattern.

Functions in the header file should have addresses
```
uint8_t pcie_get_link_speed(void);          /* 0x9a60-0x9a6b */
uint8_t pcie_get_link_speed_masked(void);   /* 0x9a30-0x9a3a */
```
